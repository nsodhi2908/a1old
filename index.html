<p>Hello! Here is my attempt at making a webpage. A webpage about me. </p>

<p> Name- Navjot Kaur Sodhi </p>

<p> Program- Geographic Information Systems- Cartographic Specilist
<p> Lives in: Kingston, Ontario </p>

<p> From: Punjab, India </p>

<p>Studying Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics since high-school and spending all my life in Punjab, India,it was very different and life-changing for me to come to Canada 
and take up Geographical Information Systems. This program has over all been really interesting and eventful for me. </p>

<p>I learnt the things which I am still continuing to learn I had never even heard about in my life. </p>

<p>The "About Me" page contains some information about me and the work that I created while in this program. </p>
